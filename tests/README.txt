For submission, your code should write only the hash (as a 128-character ASCII string) to standard out. Example output strings can be seen in the "hashonly" output files. Such a file would be produced with something like the shell command

./sha input1.txt >> output1-hashonly.txt

You are also provided with verbose output to help you debug.
